    <h1>ITMD-361 Project 1</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! These pages have been created for a class project. This specific page describe the project introduce each page. The goal of this project is to create three websites using only HTML, then publish them to GitHub. In this lesson I learned the basics of structuring websites and links in GitHub.</p>

    <p>You are here! This specific page introduces readers to the topics and rest of the pages. </p>
    <h3><a href="/project_1/Norse/norse.html">Norse Gods</a></h3>
    <p>This page introduces a few Old Norse gods as they are portrayed in myths. I picked this topic because I am currently taking a class on Norse mythology at IIT, and thought this would be some interesting, non-technical information to share.</p>
    <h3><a href="/project_1/Resume/resume.html">Resume</a></h3>
    <p>This is my resume. It is based on what I submitted to Admissions.</p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
